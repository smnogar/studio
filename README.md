## Self-hosting

Foxglove Studio can be run as a standalone [desktop application](https://foxglove.dev/download), accessed in your browser at [studio.foxglove.dev](https://studio.foxglove.dev/), or self-hosted on your own domain.

A Docker image is provided to make self-hosting easy. You can run it like so:

```sh
docker run --rm -p "8080:8080" ghcr.io/foxglove/studio:latest
```

Foxglove Studio will then be accessible in your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

**Getting started:**

1. Clone repo
1. Run `yarn install`
1. Launch the development environment:

```sh
# To launch the desktop app (run both scripts concurrently):
$ yarn serve        # start webpack
$ yarn start        # launch electron

# To launch the browser app:
$ yarn web:serve

# To launch the browser app using a local instance of the backend server:
$ yarn web:serve:local

# To launch the storybook:
$ yarn storybook

# Advanced usage: running webpack and electron on different computers (or VMs) on the same network
$ yarn serve --host 192.168.xxx.yyy         # the address where electron can reach the webpack dev server
$ yarn dlx electron@13.0.0-beta.13 .webpack # launch the version of electron for the current computer's platform
```

A [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) to self-host the browser app is also available.

**Other useful commands:**

### Credits

Foxglove Studio originally began as a fork of [Webviz](https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz), an open source project developed by [Cruise](https://getcruise.com/). The codebase has since changed significantly, with a port to TypeScript, more [panels](https://foxglove.dev/docs/panels/introduction), additional [data sources](https://foxglove.dev/docs/connection/data-sources), improved [layout management](https://foxglove.dev/docs/layouts), new [team features](https://foxglove.dev/blog/announcing-foxglove-for-teams), and an [Extension API](https://foxglove.dev/docs/extensions/getting-started).
